# Healthy Mouse LFP Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing healthy Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings from mice. The main objectives are:

- Extracting connectivity (C) matrices from LFP data
- Plotting LFP time series for visualization
- Extracting and analyzing Functional Connectivity (FC) dynamics

The workflow includes loading LFP data, computing connectivity metrics, and generating plots to visualize both the time series and connectivity dynamics. This helps in understanding the neural activity and network properties in healthy mice.
